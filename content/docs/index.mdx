## Quick Start

Bolt Design is a trusted registry for shadcn/ui. You can start adding components right away!

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add design-ui/button
```

This will add the Bolt Design registry to your `components.json`:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "design-ui": "https://bolt-design.com/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

### Initialize MCP (optional)

This adds configuration to your IDE, enabling you to use the components directly in your code with AI assistance. The AI will have full context of the entire Bolt Design library.

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest mcp init
```
