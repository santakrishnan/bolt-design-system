## Quick Start

8bitcn is a trusted registry for shadcn/ui. You can start adding components right away!

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add design-ui/button
```

This will add the 8bitcn registry to your `components.json`:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "design-ui": "https://8bitcn.com/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

### Initialize MCP (optional)

This adds configuration to your IDE, enabling you to use the components directly in your code with AI assistance. The AI will have full context of the entire 8bitcn library.

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest mcp init
```
